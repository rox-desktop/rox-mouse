			Mouse
			Configure Mouse
			by Guido Schimmels

Brief
~~~~~
Mouse lets you configure mouse buttons and mouse cursor.

New versions can be found here:

	http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/Mouse

You need to be running a recent (later than 0.1.21) version of ROX-Session,
otherwise it won't work.


Emulate3Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have a two button mouse, you can configure the X server so that
pressing both buttons at once simulates pressing the missing middle button.

However, this isn't controlled by this configlet; instead it's an X server
setting, so try editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf (the option is called
"Emulate3Buttons"). Your distribution may come with a graphical tool to help
with this.
