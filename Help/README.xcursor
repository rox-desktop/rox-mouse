Xcursor (mostly) follows the freedesktop.org spec for theming icons.  The
default search path it uses is $HOME/.icons, /usr/share/icons,
/usr/share/pimaps, /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icons.  Within each of these
directorys, it searches for a directory using the theme name.  Within the
theme directory, it looks for cursor files in the 'cursors' subdirectory.
It uses the first cursor file found along  the path.

If necessary, Xcursor also looks for a "index.theme" file in each theme
directory to find inherited themes and searches along the path for those
themes as well.

If no theme is set, or if no cursor is found for the specified theme,
Xcursor checks the "default" theme.
